    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¾ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>¼ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>¾ cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Rinse the mushrooms and pat
        dry. Season the flour with salt and pepper and dredge the chicken
        breasts in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high
        heat and saute the chicken until it is nicely browned on one side (about
        3 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic. Turn the chicken breasts and scatter the mushrooms over
        them. Continue frying, shaking the skillet and stirring the mushrooms.
        Cook for about 3 minutes, then add the vinegar, broth, bay leaf and
        thyme. Cover tightly and simmer over medium low heat for 10 minutes,
        turning occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken to a warm serving platter and cover with foil. Set
        aside. Continue simmering the sauce, uncovered, over medium high heat
        for about 7 minutes. Swirl in the butter or margarine and discard the
        bay leaf. Pour this mushroom sauce mixture over the chicken and serve.
